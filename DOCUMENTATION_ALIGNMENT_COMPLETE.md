# Documentation Alignment Complete - Summary

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## What Was Accomplished

### Problem Statement
Before starting Phase 6, we needed to ensure all documentation accurately reflects the current implementation, so that:
1. New context windows can pick up easily
2. No confusion about what's been built vs what's planned
3. Clear guidance for Phase 6 implementation

### Solution: Three-Document Strategy

We created a comprehensive documentation set that covers all aspects:

## 📚 New Documentation

### 1. **CONTEXT_QUICKSTART.md** ← START HERE
**Purpose:** Get up to speed in <5 minutes

**Contains:**
- Project health dashboard (tests, database, performance)
- Essential documents with "when to read" guidance
- Architecture at a glance (single diagram)
- All 16 Interactor methods with code examples
- Phase 6 roadmap (3 tracks with file paths)
- Development workflow (setup, branch, commit)
- Testing strategy (unit/integration/E2E)
- Code style guidelines (type annotations, docstrings)
- Common tasks (add CLI command, LLM provider, etc.)
- Debugging tips
- FAQ

**Best for:** Starting a new conversation, onboarding developers

---

### 2. **docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md** ← DEEP DIVE
**Purpose:** Complete architectural reference

**Contains:**
- Layer-by-layer breakdown (8 layers)
- Complete component inventory (managers, services, entities)
- 3 detailed data flow examples
- Dependency injection explanation
- Storage architecture (SQLite, JSON, ChromaDB)
- Performance metrics (35k cards, <1ms lookups)
- Phase 6 extension points (where to add code)
- Testing strategy with test counts
- Key architectural decisions

**Best for:** Understanding system architecture, planning features

---

### 3. **docs/architecture/README.md** ← NAVIGATION
**Purpose:** Guide to architecture documentation

**Contains:**
- Pointer to ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md as primary reference
- Quick reference diagram
- Key metrics
- Extension points summary
- Links to related docs (roadmap, phase plans)
- Tips for new context windows

**Best for:** Finding the right documentation

```

### Archived Documents
- Moved outdated architecture docs to `docs/archive/`
- Preserved for historical reference
- Not needed for day-to-day development

---

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### Before Cleanup
❌ Architecture docs scattered and outdated  
❌ Mix of current and historical info  
❌ No clear entry point for new context  
❌ Hard to find what's been built vs planned  

### After Cleanup
✅ Single source of truth: ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md  
✅ Quick entry point: CONTEXT_QUICKSTART.md  
✅ Clear navigation: architecture/README.md  
✅ Historical docs archived but preserved  
✅ All docs reflect actual implementation  
✅ Easy to pick up in new context windows

## 💡 Tips for Next Context Window

When starting a new conversation, share:

1. **CONTEXT_QUICKSTART.md** - Get 80% of context in 5 minutes
2. **ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md** - If doing architecture work
3. **PHASE_6_PLAN.md** - If implementing Phase 6

These three docs contain everything needed to:
- Understand what's been built
- Know current capabilities
- Start implementing Phase 6
- Make architectural decisions

No need to explore codebase or ask clarifying questions about structure.
