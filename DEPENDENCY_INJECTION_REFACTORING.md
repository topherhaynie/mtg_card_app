# Dependency Injection Refactoring Complete

## Overview

This document describes the architectural refactoring completed to implement proper dependency injection across the MTG Card App. This refactoring was necessary before proceeding to Phase 3 (LLM integration) to ensure clean separation of concerns and proper architectural patterns.

## Problems Identified

### 1. Violation of Dependency Injection Principle

**Problem**: Managers were creating their own service dependencies with default fallbacks.

**Example (BAD)**:
```python
class RAGManager:
    def __init__(self, embedding_service=None, vector_store=None):
        self.embedding_service = embedding_service or SentenceTransformerEmbeddingService()
        self.vector_store = vector_store or ChromaVectorStoreService(...)
```

**Why This is Bad**:
- Managers have hard-coded knowledge of specific implementations
- Violates the Dependency Inversion Principle
- Makes testing difficult (can't easily inject mocks)
- Creates tight coupling between layers

### 2. Incorrect File Organization

**Problem**: Service implementations were placed in `interfaces/` directory instead of under their associated managers.

**Before (BAD)**:
```
interfaces/
├── card_data/
│   ├── base.py              # CardDataService protocol
│   └── scryfall_service.py  # ScryfallCardDataService implementation
├── embedding/
│   ├── base.py              # EmbeddingService protocol
│   └── sentence_transformer_service.py
└── vector_store/
    ├── base.py              # VectorStoreService protocol
    └── chroma_service.py    # ChromaVectorStoreService implementation
```

**Why This is Bad**:
- Services are not colocated with the managers that use them
- `interfaces/` should contain abstract protocols, not implementations
- Doesn't match the user's original architectural vision

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Proper Dependency Injection

**Updated Managers** to require injected services (no defaults):

```python
class RAGManager:
    def __init__(
        self,
        embedding_service: EmbeddingService,  # Required, not Optional
        vector_store: VectorStoreService,      # Required, not Optional
    ):
        """Initialize the RAG manager.

        Args:
            embedding_service: Embedding service implementation (required)
            vector_store: Vector store service implementation (required)
        """
        self.embedding_service = embedding_service
        self.vector_store = vector_store
```

```python
class CardDataManager:
    def __init__(
        self,
        card_service: CardService,
        card_data_service: CardDataService,  # Required, not Optional
    ):
        """Initialize the card data manager.

        Args:
            card_service: Service for local card storage
            card_data_service: Card data service implementation (required)
        """
        self.card_service = card_service
        self.card_data_service = card_data_service
```

### 2. ManagerRegistry as Dependency Container

**Updated ManagerRegistry** to handle all service instantiation and injection:

```python
class ManagerRegistry:
    def __init__(
        self,
        data_dir: str = "data",
        card_data_service: Optional[CardDataService] = None,
        embedding_service: Optional[EmbeddingService] = None,
        vector_store_service: Optional[VectorStoreService] = None,
    ):
        """Initialize the manager registry.

        Args:
            data_dir: Directory for data storage
            card_data_service: Optional card data service (uses Scryfall if not provided)
            embedding_service: Optional embedding service (uses SentenceTransformers if not provided)
            vector_store_service: Optional vector store service (uses ChromaDB if not provided)
        """
        self.data_dir = data_dir

        # Initialize services (use defaults if not provided)
        self._card_data_service = card_data_service or ScryfallCardDataService()
        self._embedding_service = embedding_service or SentenceTransformerEmbeddingService()
        self._vector_store_service = vector_store_service or ChromaVectorStoreService(
            data_dir=f"{data_dir}/chroma",
            collection_name="mtg_cards",
        )

        # Core managers (lazy-loaded via properties)
        self._db_manager: Optional[DatabaseManager] = None
        self._card_data_manager: Optional[CardDataManager] = None
        self._rag_manager: Optional[RAGManager] = None

    @property
    def rag_manager(self) -> RAGManager:
        """Get the RAG manager."""
        if self._rag_manager is None:
            self._rag_manager = RAGManager(
                embedding_service=self._embedding_service,
                vector_store=self._vector_store_service,
            )
        return self._rag_manager
```

### 3. Reorganized File Structure

**Moved services** to their proper locations under managers:

**After (GOOD)**:
```
managers/
├── card_data/
│   ├── manager.py
│   └── services/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── base.py              # CardDataService protocol
│       └── scryfall_service.py  # ScryfallCardDataService implementation
├── rag/
│   ├── manager.py
│   └── services/
│       ├── __init__.py          # Exports all RAG services
│       ├── embedding/
│       │   ├── __init__.py
│       │   ├── base.py          # EmbeddingService protocol
│       │   └── sentence_transformer_service.py
│       └── vector_store/
│           ├── __init__.py
│           ├── base.py          # VectorStoreService protocol
│           └── chroma_service.py
└── db/
    ├── manager.py
    └── services/
        └── ...
```

**Benefits**:
- Services are colocated with the managers that use them
- Clear ownership and responsibility
- Easy to find implementations
- Matches the user's architectural vision

## Updated Import Paths

### Before:
```python
from mtg_card_app.interfaces.card_data import CardDataService, ScryfallCardDataService
from mtg_card_app.interfaces.embedding import EmbeddingService, SentenceTransformerEmbeddingService
from mtg_card_app.interfaces.vector_store import VectorStoreService, ChromaVectorStoreService
```

### After:
```python
from mtg_card_app.managers.card_data.services import CardDataService, ScryfallCardDataService
from mtg_card_app.managers.rag.services import (
    EmbeddingService,
    SentenceTransformerEmbeddingService,
    VectorStoreService,
    ChromaVectorStoreService,
)
```

## Usage Pattern

### Before (Direct Instantiation):
```python
# BAD - Manager creates its own dependencies
rag = RAGManager(data_dir="data")  # Implicitly creates SentenceTransformers + ChromaDB
```

### After (Dependency Injection via Registry):
```python
# GOOD - Registry handles all dependency wiring
registry = ManagerRegistry(data_dir="data")
rag = registry.rag_manager  # Services already injected

# For advanced users who want to customize services:
from mtg_card_app.managers.rag.services import CustomEmbeddingService, CustomVectorStore

custom_registry = ManagerRegistry(
    data_dir="data",
    embedding_service=CustomEmbeddingService(),
    vector_store_service=CustomVectorStore(),
)
```

## Benefits of This Refactoring

### 1. True Dependency Injection
- Managers receive dependencies instead of creating them
- Easy to swap implementations
- Follows SOLID principles (Dependency Inversion Principle)

### 2. Better Testability
- Can easily inject mock services for testing
- No need to monkey-patch imports
- Each component is independently testable

### 3. Clear Architectural Layers
```
Core Layer (manager_registry.py)
    ↓ instantiates & injects
Manager Layer (managers/*/manager.py)
    ↓ uses
Service Layer (managers/*/services/)
    ↓ wraps
External Dependencies (ChromaDB, SentenceTransformers, Scryfall API)
```

### 4. Flexibility
- Users can provide custom service implementations
- Default implementations for ease of use
- Easy to add new services without modifying managers

### 5. Maintainability
- Services colocated with their consumers
- Clear ownership and responsibility
- Easy to understand which manager uses which services

## Files Modified

### Core Files:
- `mtg_card_app/core/manager_registry.py` - Added service instantiation and injection logic
- `mtg_card_app/managers/card_data/manager.py` - Removed default service instantiation
- `mtg_card_app/managers/rag/manager.py` - Removed default service instantiation

### New Service Structure:
- `mtg_card_app/managers/card_data/services/` - CardDataService and implementations
- `mtg_card_app/managers/rag/services/embedding/` - EmbeddingService and implementations
- `mtg_card_app/managers/rag/services/vector_store/` - VectorStoreService and implementations

### Examples Updated:
- `examples/rag_demo.py` - Updated to use ManagerRegistry

## Testing

All functionality has been verified:
- ✅ RAG demo runs successfully with new architecture
- ✅ All service injections working correctly
- ✅ Semantic search still functioning properly
- ✅ Vector store operations working
- ✅ Embedding generation working

## Next Steps

Now that proper dependency injection is in place, we can proceed with:

### Phase 3: LLM Integration
- Integrate Ollama for combo analysis
- Add LLM service abstraction (following same pattern)
- Implement combo recommendation system

### Future Enhancements:
- Consider creating a dedicated `DependencyManager` class for more complex scenarios
- Add configuration file support for default services
- Implement service lifecycle management (startup/shutdown hooks)

## Architectural Principles Followed

1. **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear responsibility
3. **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension (new services), closed for modification
4. **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused service protocols
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear layers with well-defined boundaries

## Conclusion

This refactoring establishes a solid architectural foundation for the MTG Card App. The proper dependency injection pattern makes the codebase more maintainable, testable, and flexible for future enhancements. We're now ready to proceed with Phase 3 (LLM integration) with confidence that the architecture can support it cleanly.
