```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Activate the Environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Run the Demo

```bash
python -m examples.data_layer_demo
```

This will:
- Fetch sample MTG cards from Scryfall
- Store them in `data/cards.json`
- Create a sample combo (Isochron Scepter + Dramatic Reversal)
- Demonstrate all architecture layers

### Deactivate When Done

```bash
deactivate
```

## 🛠️ Common Commands

### Package Management with uv

```bash
# Install a new package
uv pip install package-name

# Install with specific version
uv pip install package-name==1.2.3

# Uninstall a package
uv pip uninstall package-name

# List installed packages
uv pip list

# Show package info
uv pip show package-name

# Freeze dependencies
uv pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=mtg_card_app

# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=mtg_card_app --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html  # macOS
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Run the data layer demo
python -m examples.data_layer_demo

# Use entry points (defined in pyproject.toml)
mtg-card-app
mtg-deck-builder
mtg-card-search
```

## ✨ What's Working

### Core Functionality (Phase 1 - Complete)

✅ **Domain Layer**
- Card entity with full Scryfall integration
- Combo entity with pricing calculations
- ComboType enum for categorization

✅ **Scryfall Integration**
- API client with rate limiting (10 req/sec)
- Card search, autocomplete, bulk data
- Free-tier compliant (no API key needed)

✅ **Storage Layer**
- JSON-based persistence
- Card and combo services with CRUD operations
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities

✅ **Manager Layer**
- Database manager (coordinates all services)
- Card data manager with intelligent caching
- Dependency injection via ManagerRegistry

✅ **Orchestration**
- Interactor for high-level use cases
- Clean API for all operations
- Sample data initialization

## 🎯 Next Steps

Now that your environment is set up, you can choose which phase to implement next:

### Phase 2: RAG Integration 🔍
Add semantic search capabilities:
- Set up ChromaDB for vector storage
- Create embeddings for card oracle text
- Implement "find similar combos" features
- Enable natural language card search

### Phase 3: LLM Integration 🤖
Add AI-powered analysis:
- Install and configure Ollama with local LLaMA
- Create combo analysis service
- Implement auto-generation of combo descriptions
- Build card synergy detection

### Phase 4: MCP Interface 💬
Create natural language interface:
- Build MCP server for queries
- Parse commands like "find infinite mana combos under $50"
- Add conversational deck building
- Enable multi-turn interactions

### Phase 5: Deck Builder 🎴
Complete the application:
- Format-aware deck validation
- Mana curve analysis
- Budget optimization
- Export to various formats

## 🧪 Verification Steps Completed

✓ Virtual environment created with uv
✓ Package installed in editable mode with `uv pip install -e .`
✓ Development dependencies installed with `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`
✓ All imports verified successfully
✓ ComboType import issue identified and resolved
✓ Environment ready for development

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Import Errors

If you see import errors, make sure:
```bash
# You're in the right directory
cd /Users/christopherhaynie/Developer/mtg_card_app

# The venv is activated
source .venv/bin/activate

# Verify installation
uv pip list
```

### Scryfall API Errors

The demo fetches cards from Scryfall. If you hit rate limits:
- Wait a few seconds between runs
- The rate limiter is built-in (100ms between requests)
- Scryfall is generous with free-tier usage

### Data Directory

The `data/` directory is created automatically when you run the demo.
To reset:
```bash
rm -rf data/
```

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your environment is configured and ready for development. The data layer architecture is solid, modular, and ready to expand with RAG, LLM, and MCP features.

### What to Do Next?

1. **Test the Demo**
   ```bash
   python -m examples.data_layer_demo
   ```

2. **Explore the Architecture**
   - Read `ARCHITECTURE_FLOW.md` for visual diagrams
   - Check out the code in `mtg_card_app/`

3. **Choose Your Next Phase**
   Let me know which feature you'd like to add next:
   - RAG for semantic search
   - LLM for combo analysis
   - MCP for natural language interface
   - Deck builder functionality

**Happy coding! 🚀**
