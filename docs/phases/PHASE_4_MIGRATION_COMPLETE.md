# Phase 4 Migration Complete

**Date:** October 21, 2025

## Summary

Phase 4 (MCP Interface) is now complete. All required features, tests, and scale-up steps have been implemented and validated:

- MCPManager supports both legacy and JSON-RPC 2.0 protocols with schema validation and error contract alignment.
- All core tools (query_cards, search_cards, find_combo_pieces, explain_card, compare_cards) are implemented and tested.
- History, observability, and output validation features are in place.
- E2E tests and performance checks are green.
- Full Oracle card database imported and vectorized for RAG; semantic search verified at scale.
- No blocking issues remain; only nice-to-haves are backlogged.

## Next Steps
- Roadmap updated to mark Phase 4 as complete.
- Begin planning for Phase 5 (Deck Builder).
