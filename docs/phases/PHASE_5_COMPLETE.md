**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Total Time:** ~3 weeks (Oct 1-21, 2025)

---

## Overview

Phase 5 implemented a comprehensive AI-powered deck building system with intelligent card suggestions, advanced combo detection, and flexible user controls via MCP/CLI interfaces.

---

## Completed Features

- Format constraints (Commander, Modern, Standard, etc.)
- Commander specification for singleton formats
- Metadata support (theme, description, etc.)
- Card pool validation

✅ **validate_deck**: Legality checking
- Format-specific rules (deck size, card limits)
- Banned/restricted list checking
- Color identity validation (Commander)
- Singleton enforcement (Commander)

✅ **analyze_deck**: Comprehensive analysis
- Mana curve distribution
- Card type breakdown
- Color distribution
- Average CMC calculation
- Weakness identification
- Missing critical pieces

✅ **suggest_cards**: AI-powered recommendations
- RAG-based semantic search
- Synergy scoring (0.0-1.0)
- Weakness detection
- Combo detection and ranking
- LLM-powered explanations

✅ **export_deck**: Export to multiple formats
- Plain text with sections
- JSON format
- Moxfield import format
- MTGO format
- MTG Arena format
- Archidekt import format

### 2. Advanced Combo Ranking System

**10 Weighted Factors:**

1. **Archetype Fit** (+10 points)
   - Matches deck theme/tags
   - Examples: "control", "aggro", "aristocrats"

2. **Commander Synergy** (+15 points)
   - Combo directly involves the commander
   - Critical for Commander format

3. **Color Identity Overlap** (+5 per matching color)
   - Fits within deck's color identity
   - Prevents illegal suggestions

4. **Budget Fit** (+10 if under, penalty if over)
   - Respects user's budget constraints
   - Scales penalty by percentage over

5. **Power Level Fit** (+8 if matching)
   - Matches target power level (1-10 scale)
   - Casual (1-3) → Optimized (4-7) → cEDH (8-10)

6. **Complexity** (+5 low, -3 high)
   - Simple combos preferred
   - Low < Medium < High complexity

7. **Assembly Ease** (+8 for 2-card, +4 for 3-card, penalty for 4+)
   - Fewer pieces = easier to assemble
   - 2-card combos highly valued

8. **Disruptibility Penalty** (-2 per weakness)
   - Accounts for documented weaknesses
   - Examples: dies to removal, requires haste, needs specific mana

9. **Infinite Combo Boost** (+12 points)
   - Infinite combos are high-value
   - Game-winning potential

10. **Popularity Boost** (+5 * popularity_score)
    - Community-tested combos
    - Proven track record

### 3. Flexible User Controls

**Constraint Options:**

```python
constraints = {
    # Basic constraints
    "theme": "control",          # str: Deck archetype
    "budget": 200.0,             # float: Max total USD
    "power": 7,                  # int: 1-10 power level
    "banned": ["Card Name"],     # list: Exclude specific cards
    "n_results": 10,             # int: Max suggestions
    
    # Combo controls
    "combo_mode": "focused",     # str: "focused" or "broad"
    "combo_limit": 3,            # int: Max combos per suggestion
    "combo_types": [             # list: Filter by combo type
        "infinite_mana",
        "infinite_draw",
        "infinite_damage",
        "infinite_life",
        "infinite_tokens",
        "infinite_mill",
        "lock",
        "one_shot",
        "engine",
        "synergy",
        "other"
    ],
    "exclude_cards": [           # list: Additional exclusions
        "Thassa's Oracle",
        "Demonic Consultation"
    ],
    
    # Output controls
    "sort_by": "power",          # str: "power", "price", "popularity", "complexity"
    "explain_combos": True,      # bool: Include LLM explanations
}
```

### 4. Combo Detection Modes

**Focused Mode** (default):
- Only suggests combos matching constraints
- Respects theme, format, colors, budget
- Higher precision, fewer results

**Broad Mode**:
- Shows all relevant combos
- Useful for exploration
- Higher recall, more results

### 5. Sorting Options

Users can sort combo results by:

- **power** (default): Ranking score (high → low)
- **price**: Total combo price (low → high)
- **popularity**: Community usage (high → low)
- **complexity**: Simplicity (low → medium → high)

### 6. LLM-Powered Explanations

When `explain_combos: True`:
- 2-3 sentence explanation per combo
- Context about deck synergy
- Power level and gameplay timing
- Generated on-demand for performance

**Example:**
> "This combo generates infinite mana which synergizes perfectly with your control theme by enabling big X spells and card draw. It's highly efficient at 2 pieces and fits your budget at $15 total. Best assembled mid-game after establishing board control."

### 7. Exhaustive Combo Search

The system checks all combinations:
- Suggested card + every deck card
- Suggested card + commander (if present)
- Suggested card + other suggested cards
- Applies all filters at each step

**Search complexity:** O(n * m) where:
- n = number of suggested cards
- m = number of deck cards + commander + other suggestions

## Integration Points

### MCP Interface

New tools added to `MTGCardMCPServer`:
- `handle_build_deck(format, pool, commander, constraints, metadata)`
- `handle_validate_deck(deck)`
- `handle_analyze_deck(deck)`
- `handle_suggest_cards(deck, constraints)`
- `handle_export_deck(deck, export_format)`

### CLI Interface

Enhanced `mtg-deck-builder` with:
- Comprehensive help text for constraints
- JSON constraint parsing
- All 10 constraint parameters documented
- Examples in help output
- Export command with 6 format options

### Programmatic API

Direct access via `Interactor`:
```python
from mtg_card_app.core.manager_registry import ManagerRegistry
from mtg_card_app.domain.entities.deck import Deck

interactor = ManagerRegistry.get_instance().interactor

# Build
deck = interactor.build_deck("Commander", pool, "Muldrotha")

# Validate
results = interactor.validate_deck(deck)

# Analyze
analysis = interactor.analyze_deck(deck)

# Suggest with constraints
suggestions = interactor.suggest_cards(deck, {
    "theme": "control",
    "budget": 100.0,
    "combo_mode": "focused",
    "explain_combos": True
})

# Export to various formats
text_export = interactor.export_deck(deck, "text")
moxfield_export = interactor.export_deck(deck, "moxfield")
arena_export = interactor.export_deck(deck, "arena")
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Current Performance

- **Basic suggestion**: ~100-500ms (RAG search)
- **With combo detection**: ~500-2000ms (depends on deck size)
- **With LLM explanations**: +1-3s per combo (sequential)

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Caching:**
   - Cache combo search results per deck hash
   - Cache popular combo data
   - Cache RAG embeddings for common cards

2. **Batching:**
   - Batch combo queries to database
   - Batch LLM explanation generation
   - Parallel RAG searches for multiple cards

3. **Async Operations:**
   - Async combo detection
   - Async LLM calls
   - Stream results as they're ready

4. **Index Optimization:**
   - Index combo tables by card IDs
   - Pre-compute popular combo rankings
   - Materialized views for common queries

5. **Smart Limiting:**
   - Early termination for top-N results
   - Progressive refinement (fast → precise)
   - User-controlled depth vs speed trade-off

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Constraints

1. **Function Complexity:**
   - `suggest_cards` has 54 complexity (limit: 10)
   - 50 branches (limit: 12)
   - 148 statements (limit: 50)
   - **Mitigation:** Tests pass, features work, refactoring deferred

2. **Sequential Processing:**
   - Combo searches are sequential
   - LLM explanations block
   - **Mitigation:** Plan for async in performance phase

3. **No Caching:**
   - Repeated queries recompute
   - Same deck analyzed multiple times
   - **Mitigation:** Add caching layer in performance phase

4. **Memory Usage:**
   - Loads all combos into memory for ranking
   - Could be optimized with streaming
   - **Mitigation:** Currently acceptable for <100 combos/suggestion

### Future Improvements

- [ ] Refactor `suggest_cards` into helper methods
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Implement caching layer
- [ ] Add async operations
- [ ] Stream results for large queries
- [ ] ML-powered impact prediction
- [ ] User feedback loop for ranking refinement
