## What Changed (Planning Phase)

### 1. Created Comprehensive Phase 6 Plan
**File:** `docs/phases/PHASE_6_PLAN.md` (formerly PHASE_6_PLAN_V2.md)

**Key Improvements:**
- âœ… **Capability Inventory** - Complete list of all Interactor methods that must be exposed
- âœ… **Detailed Command Map** - Comprehensive CLI commands with all options and examples
- âœ… **Conversational-First Design** - Chat mode is primary (80%), commands are secondary (20%)
- âœ… **Three Parallel Tracks** - CLI, LLM Providers, Installation can be developed simultaneously
- âœ… **Realistic Timeline** - 2-3 weeks with day-by-day breakdown

**All Exposed Functionality:**
- **Card Operations:** fetch, search, import, budget, natural language queries, combo pieces
- **Combo Operations:** create, find by card, find by budget
- **Deck Operations:** build, validate, analyze, suggest (with 10-factor ranking), export
- **System Operations:** stats, setup, update

**Command Categories:**
- `mtg` (chat mode) - Primary interface
- `mtg search` - Card searches with filters
- `mtg card` - Card details
- `mtg combo` - Combo operations (find, search, create, budget)
- `mtg deck` - Deck operations (new, build, validate, analyze, suggest, export)
- `mtg import` - Bulk card import
- `mtg config` - Configuration management
- `mtg stats/update/setup` - System commands

### 2. Created Phase 7 Plan (Separate Document)
**File:** `docs/phases/PHASE_7_PLAN.md`

**Scope:**
- FastAPI backend (wraps Interactor)
- React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui frontend
- Chat interface (primary) + Quick action buttons (secondary)
- Local hosting at `localhost:3000` or `mtg.local:3000`
- 3-4 week timeline
- Complete feature breakdown and API design

**Key Decision:** Phase 7 is separate to keep Phase 6 focused on CLI + infrastructure

### 3. Updated Project Roadmap
**File:** `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`

**Changes:**
- Phase 6: "CLI & Infrastructure" (was "User Interfaces")
- Phase 7: "Web UI" (new, was part of old Phase 6)
- Added comprehensive sections for both phases
- Updated architecture diagram
- Moved future enhancements to Phase 6.1, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 8
- Updated open questions
- Updated status footer

## Next Steps

1. **Review Phase 6 Plan** - Read `docs/phases/PHASE_6_PLAN.md` thoroughly
2. **Approve or Request Changes** - Ensure all functionality is captured
3. **Commit Planning Docs:**
   ```bash
   git add docs/phases/PHASE_6_PLAN.md
   git add docs/phases/PHASE_7_PLAN.md
   git add PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
   git commit -m "docs: Complete Phase 6 and 7 planning with comprehensive command map"
   ```
4. **Begin Phase 6 Implementation** - Start parallel tracks

## Key Decisions Made

1. âœ… All Interactor methods inventoried and mapped to CLI commands
2. âœ… Subcommands allowed (e.g., `mtg deck build`, `mtg deck suggest`)
3. âœ… Phase 7 is separate document (not in Phase 6 plan)
4. âœ… Roadmap updated to reflect new phase structure
5. âœ… Conversational-first design maintained throughout

## Files Modified

- `docs/phases/PHASE_6_PLAN.md` (created, comprehensive)
- `docs/phases/PHASE_7_PLAN.md` (created, separate)
- `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` (updated sections for Phase 6 and 7)

**Status:** âœ… Planning Complete - Ready for Review
